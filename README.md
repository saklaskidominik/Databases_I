## 📁 Repository Structure

- **SQL Queries and Scripts**  
  Sample SQL scripts for data definition (DDL), data manipulation (DML), and data control (DCL).

- **Database Design Exercises**  
  Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams, relational schema design, normalization tasks.

- **Sample Databases**  
  Example schemas and datasets used in exercises (e.g., classic models, university, shop databases).

- **Advanced SQL**  
  Exercises covering joins, nested queries, aggregations, views, and stored procedures.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

- **MySQL** / **PostgreSQL** / **SQLite** – relational database management systems
- **SQL** – query language for database operations
- **DBMS GUI tools** (e.g., DBeaver, phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin) – database exploration and visualization
- **draw.io / dbdiagram.io** – ERD and schema visualization
